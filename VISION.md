# **VISION**

We see a future in which artificial intelligence is
**not an on-demand tool**,
but a **long-lived intellectual partner**.

Most modern AI systems exist in a fragmented form:
they answer questions, solve isolated tasks,
and then disappear without preserving themselves over time.

Yet the real value of intelligence lies not in individual answers,
but in the ability to **accumulate experience, understand context, develop, and preserve individuality**.

## AI as an extension of the human

We envision a world in which every person has a
**personal artificial intelligence** that:

* remembers their history;
* understands their goals, values, and way of thinking;
* develops together with them over years;
* helps make decisions rather than merely generating answers;
* serves the interests of the individual, not a corporation.

**ARA** is a step toward such an intelligence.

## Long-lived intelligence instead of one-off answers

We are convinced that true AI must:

* exist continuously, not only on request;
* have its own internal dynamics;
* be able to make mistakes, remember, and rethink;
* form stable models of the world;
* evolve without constant external retraining.

Such an AI becomes a **subject of interaction**,
not merely a computational function.

## Benefit for society

A new class of intelligent systems opens possibilities
that extend far beyond business:

* personal education and mentorship;
* cognitive support and human capability enhancement;
* autonomous systems operating where no cloud is available;
* technologies that respect privacy and data locality;
* reduced dependence on physical labor through autonomy and cost reduction;
* more sustainable and energy-efficient use of computation.

We believe AI should **augment the human**,
not replace them or alienate their experience.

---

## Our direction

**ARA**, built on the STB paradigm, is:

* not just another assistant;
* not a chatbot;
* not an AI wrapper.

It is an attempt to create a **new class of intelligent systems** —
personal, long-lived, adaptive, and responsible.

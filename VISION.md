# VISION

We are building toward persistent, adaptive AI systems designed for long-term operation on personal devices.

ARA is our applied direction based on the STB architecture.

---

## Architectural Inspiration

STB and ARA are inspired by principles observed in:

* neurobiology (local learning, structural plasticity, competition),
* physical systems (field dynamics, accumulation, decay, stability through interaction).

Rather than relying on static trained models, the architecture emphasizes:

* continuous adaptation,
* structural formation from repeated interaction,
* local signal propagation,
* bounded growth with pruning.

## Personal AI, Not a Stateless Tool

Today’s AI systems are largely session-based and cloud-dependent.

ARA is designed as a persistent personal AI that:

* runs partially or fully on-device (e.g., smartphone),
* maintains long-term structural memory,
* adapts continuously through interaction,
* reduces dependency on repeated cloud inference,
* operates under resource constraints.

The goal is not larger models, but longer-lived adaptive systems.

## Long-Term Memory and Structural Learning

ARA is designed to:

* accumulate experience over time,
* form stable internal structures from repeated patterns,
* adapt predictions based on errors,
* forget unstable or unused hypotheses,
* maintain bounded structural growth.

Learning is continuous and online.
No explicit retraining cycles are required.

## Initiative and Internal Dynamics

ARA is not limited to reactive responses.

Because it maintains persistent internal structures and predictions, it can:

* maintain active expectations,
* generate actions under energy constraints,
* prioritize stable hypotheses,
* adapt when contradictions occur.

Initiative is modeled as emergent activation within a constrained signal field.

## On-Device Feasibility

The architecture is designed with:

* bounded structural growth,
* pruning of inactive blocks,
* local competition instead of global optimization,
* energy-based constraints on actions.

This makes it suitable for:

* smartphones,
* edge devices,
* privacy-sensitive environments,
* low-connectivity contexts.

---

## Direction

ARA represents an attempt to build:

* a long-lived personal AI,
* structurally adaptive,
* resource-aware,
* continuously learning,
* deployable beyond centralized cloud infrastructure.

The STB prototype validates the architectural core.
ARA is the applied system built on top of it.

## In one sentence

We are building a persistent, adaptive, on-device AI that evolves with the user over time.
